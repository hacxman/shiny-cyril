PC     - 0xFF FF [FD-FF] - RW - 24b LE address instruction pointer
PCC    - 0xFF FF FC      -  W - PC commit. write 0x01 to jump at address in PC
STATUS - 0xFF FF FB      - ?? - unspecified yet
SYSCAL - 0xFF FF FA      - ?W - write to trigger syscall

region - 0xFE [00 00 - FF FF] - mmio

interrupts:

for simplicity there will probably be 16 interrupts while some of them reserved
for system tasks - i.e. syscall, systick, fault, etc.

INTx  - 0x00 00 [00-02] + x * 4 - 32b aligned x-th interrupt pointer
INTxC - 0x00 00 03 + x * 4      - 32b aligned x-th interrupt pointers control byte
